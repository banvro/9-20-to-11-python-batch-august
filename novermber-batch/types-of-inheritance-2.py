# Types of Inheritance:
#     1) Single level inheritance
#         1 child have 1 parrent
    
#     2) Multiple inheritance
#         1 child multiple parents
    
#     3) Multilevel Inheritance
#         grantparent <- parent <- child
        

# 4) Hirerichical Inheritance:
#     1 parent multiple child


# class cls1:
#     def mthd1(self):
#         print("this si methid 1")
    
#     def mthd2(self):
#         print("this is method 2")

# class cls2(cls1):
#     def mthd3(self):
#         print("thisis method 3")

# class cls3(cls1):
#     def mthd4(self):
#         print("this is metohd 4")

# obj = cls3()



# 5) Hybrid Inheritance : 
    # combination of two or more then tow inheritances

# heririchical + multiple 

# class cls1:
#     def mthd1(self):
#         print("this is method 1")
    
#     def mthd2(self):
#         print("this is method 2")

# class cls2(cls1):
#     def mthd3(self):
#         print("this is method 3")
    
# class cls3(cls1):
#     def mthd4(self):
#         print("this is method 4")

# class cls4(cls2, cls3):
#     def mthd5(self):
#         print("this is method 5")

# obj = cls4()
# obj.mthd4()
